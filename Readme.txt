# Weather Analysis Project

## Overview
This is our startup WeatherXYZ, we are a project that focuses on analyzing weather data for multiple cities. The dataset includes information such as maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and cloud cover. The goal is to gain insights into the weather patterns of different cities and explore the impact of climate change on a specific city.
## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

1. **`data/`**: This directory contains the input dataset (`temperature_data.csv`).

2. **`src/`**: This directory contains the Python source code for the project.

3. **`results/`**: This directory stores the results and visualizations generated during the analysis.

4. **Run the Analysis Script:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py argv1 argv2
    ```
5. argv1 = City Name, argv2 = data, graph_temp, stats
	
## Results

The visualizations and results of the analysis will be saved in the `results/` directory.
